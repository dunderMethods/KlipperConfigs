Klipper Config for OpenBeam Kossel Pro
3.19.2025 - DunderMethods
-----------------------------------

Note: This is a heavily modified machine. This config is probably most valuable to someone trying to get Klipper running on a delta with the Azteeg X5 Mini. Expect to make a lot of config tweaks to make this work with your machine. 

This config is for a heavily modified OpenBeam Kossel Pro with the following modifications:
- Panucatt Azteeg X5 Mini V3 Main Board (Replaces the original Brainwave board)
- Mini Viki 2 Display
- E3D V6 Hot End
- BL Touch Ready (Detachable, configured for use on as-need basis)
- Custom carbon fiber arms
- Custom end effector

This config is for a heavily modified machine and will require adjustments to work properly with your machine.
