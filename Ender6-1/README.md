Klipper Config for Creality Ender6 (1)
3.19.2025 - DunderMethods
-----------------------------------

Note: I have two Ender6 machines. This config is for machine #1

This config is for a stock Ender6 with the following modifications:
- E3D V6 Hot End (May use different thermistor. Different extruder offsets)
- HeroMe Gen7 Print Head Assembly (different from stock extruder offsets)

This config is for a slightly modified machine and may require adjustments to work properly with your machine.
